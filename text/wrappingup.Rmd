#### Limitations on the Central Limit Theorem

The central limit theorem tells us that the distribution of the means of random samples drawn from a population follows a normal distribution even if the population itself does not follow a normal distribution. There are a couple of important limitations to this conclusion. One is that the various sources of indeterminate error that affect the measurements we make on our samples must be independent of each other and of similar magnitude so that no one source of indeterminate error dominates the final distribution. A second limitation is that the number of individual samples included in the average must generally be greater than approximately 30. The six figures on the right shows this for a population that has the shape of a staircase (see figure in upper-left corner, which consists of four uniform distributions). The distribution of means becomes increasingly normal-like as the size of the individual samples increases from 4 (upper right) to 36 (lower right). 

#### Source of Simulations

The data for the distributions were simulated using `R` and have the following properties:

+ the normal distribution has 5000 individual samples drawn from a population with a mean of 25 and a standard deviation of 10 using the `rnorm()` function

+ the binomial distribution has 5000 individual samples drawn from a population that is number of positive results in five trials given a probability of 0.2 for a positive result using the `rbinom()` function

+ the Poisson distribution has 5000 individual samples drawn from a population with an average rate of 5 using the `rpois()` function

+ the uniform distribution has 5000 individual samples drawn from a population with a minimum value of 5 and a maximum value of 45 using the `runif()` function

+ the bimodal distribution has 10,000 individual samples, half drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 2, and half drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 5 

+ the staircase distribution is an overlay of four uniform distributions consisting of 1000, 2500, 5000, and 7500 individual samples with minimum and maximum values of 0 and 25, 25 and 50, 50 and 75, and 75 and 100, respectively
