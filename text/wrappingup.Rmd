#### Limitations on the Central Limit Theorem

The central limit theorem tells us that the distribution of the means of random samples drawn from a population will have a normal distribution even if the population itself does not have a normal distribution. There are a couple of important limitations to this conclusion. One is that the various sources of indeterminate error that affect the analysis of samples must be independent of each other and of similar magnitude so that no one source of indeterminate error dominates the final distribution. A second limitation is that the number of individual samples that are averaged generally must be greater than approximately 30. The figures to the right shows this for an original population in the shape of a staircase (see figure in upper-left corner, which consists of four uniform distributions). The distribution of means becomes increasingly normal-like as the size of the individual samples increases from 4 to 36. 

#### Source of Simulations

The data for the original distributions were simulated using `R` and have the following properties: the normal distribution has 5000 individual samples drawn from a population with a mean of 25 and a standard deviation of 10 using the `rnorm()` function; the binomial distribution has 5000 individual samples drawn from a population with a mean size of 5 and a probability of 0.2 using the `rbinom()` function; the Poisson distribution has 5000 individual samples drawn from a population with an average rate of 5 using the `rpois()` function; and the uniform distribution has 5000 individual samples drawn from a population with a minimum value of 5 and a maximum value of 45 using the `runif()` function. For more details on these distributions, see the module AC3.0: Distributions of Data.

The bimodal distribution is an overlay of two normal distributions each consisting of 5000 individual samples with means of 10 and 50, and standard deviations of 2 and 5, respectively. The staircase distribution is an overlay of four uniform distributions consisting of 1000, 2500, 5000, and 7500 individual samples with minimum and maximum values of 0 and 25, 25 and 50, 50 and 75, and 75 and 100, respectively.
