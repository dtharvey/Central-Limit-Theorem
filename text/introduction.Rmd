$\require{mhchem}$In a quantitative analysis we determine how much analyte is present in a small sample drawn from a much larger population. For example, we might analyze five tablets of a pain reliever from a single bottle that holds 100 tablets, obtaining results of $224.3$, $240.4$, $261.7$, $229.4$, and $246.3$ mg. The bottle, in turn, is drawn from a single production lot, which might be $10^4$ to $10^5$ bottles. To use a sample's properties---such as its mean or standard deviation---to learn something about the population, such as the percentage of tablets that are likely to have more than $250$ mg of pain reliever, requires that we know the mathematical properties of the population's distribution. Although there are many types of distributions, the distribution that receives the most attention is the normal distribution, which is defined by its mean, $\mu$ and its standard deviation, $\sigma$.

#### The Normal Distribution

The figure on the right shows a normal distribution for a population that has a mean, $\mu$, of $0$ and a standard deviation, $\sigma$, of 1. The frequency of outcomes is on the *y*-axis and possible outcomes are on the *x*-axis. The percentage of a normal distribution within a range of values is defined only by the population's mean and standard deviation. For example, half of a population's members have values less than $\mu$, as shown by the area in black, and 34.13% have values between $\mu$ and $\mu + 1 \sigma$ as shown by the area in light blue. The total area under the normal distribution curve---a cumulative probability of 100%---is the same for all populations. 

#### The Central Limit Theorem

The well-characterized properties of a normal distribution allow us to draw conclusions about a population based on the analysis of a limited number of samples drawn at random from the population ***if*** we know the samples are normally distributed. The Central Limit Theorem is simply a statement that regardless of the actual distribution of the individual samples that make up a population, the distribution of the means of samples of sufficient size, $n$, drawn from that population are normally distributed.
