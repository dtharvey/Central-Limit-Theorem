<!-- text for introduction -->

The goal of a quantitative analysis is to determine the amount of analyte present in a small sample drawn from a much larger population. For example, we might analyze five tablets of a pain reliever from a single bottle, obtaining results of 224.3, 240.4, 261.7, 229.4, and 246.3 mg of acetaminophen. Each individual tablet is a sample drawn from the larger population of all tablets that form a single production lot, which might be $10^6$ bottles. To use a sample's properties---such as its mean (246.6 mg) or its standard deviation (8.75 mg)---to learn something about the population---such as the percentage of tablets that are likely to have more than 250 mg of acetaminophen---requires that we know the mathematical properties of the population's distribution. Although there are many different types of distributions, the one that receives the most attention is the normal distribution.

#### The Normal Distribution

The figure on the right shows the characteristic properties of the normal distribution for a population with a mean ($\mu$) of 0 and a standard deviation ($\sigma$) of 1. The plot shows the frequency of an outcome on the *y*-axis as a function of the possible outcomes on the *x*-axis. The normal distribution is symmetrical around its mean and the most frequent outcome is the mean. Of particular importance is that the percentage of the population that falls within any range has a specific value defined by $\mu$ and $\sigma$. For example, 99.72% of the population is within three standard deviations on either side of the mean $(\mu \pm 3 \sigma)$ and 13.59% of the population falls within the range $\mu + 1 \sigma$ and $\mu + 2 \sigma$. The total area under the normal distribution---a cumulative probability of 100%---is the same for all populations. These well-characterized properties of a normal distribution allow us to draw conclusions about a population based on the analysis of a limited number of samples drawn at random from the population.
