<h4>Visuallizing the Central Limit Theorem</h4>
<p>The figure on the right shows histograms for two distributions, each
consisting of 5000 samples drawn from a population whose actual
distribution is defined by the pop-up menu. If we draw 5000 samples from
this population one-at-a-time, we obtain the distribution on the left.
If we collect 5000 samples, each of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is an integer between 2 and 50, we
obtain the distribution on the right. The mean and the standard
deviation for each distribution is shown above the histogram.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. Verify that the pop-up menu is set to
“normal” and that the slider for “samples to average” is set to 2. In
what ways are the two distributions on the right similar to each other
and in what ways are they different from each other?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. Use the slider to adjust the number of
individual samples to average to values of 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49,
recording the mean and the standard deviation for each value of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Examine your data and determine the
relationship between <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\mu_n\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_n\)</span> are the mean values for samples of
size 1 and of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. What is the
relationship between <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_1\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_n\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_n\)</span> are the standard deviations for
samples of size 1 and samples of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. There are other types of well-defined
distributions, including the binomial, Poisson, and uniform
distributions. Use the pop-up menu and the slider to explore what
happens when you sample these distributions. Explain how your results
are consistent with the central limit theorem.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 4</strong>. Many populations do not follow a
well-defined distribution. For example, if the material we are sampling
has two types of particles, each with a different amount of analyte,
then it will show a bimodal distribution. Use the pop-up menu to select
the bimodal distribution and determine if the central limit theorem
applies in this case.</p>
