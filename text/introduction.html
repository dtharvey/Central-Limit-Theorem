<p>The goal of a quantitative analysis is to determine how much analyte
is present in a small sample drawn from a much larger population. For
example, we might analyze five tablets of a pain reliever drawn at
random from a single bottle that holds 100 tablets, obtaining results of
224.3, 240.4, 261.7, 229.4, and 246.3 mg of acetaminophen. The bottle,
in turn, is drawn from all the bottles in a single production lot, which
might be <span class="math inline">\(10^6\)</span> bottles. To use a
sample’s properties—such as its mean (246.6 mg) or its standard
deviation (8.75 mg)—to learn something about the population—such as the
percentage of tablets that are likely to have more than 250 mg of
acetaminophen—requires that we know the mathematical properties of the
population’s distribution. Although there are many different types of
distributions), the distribution that receives the most attention is the
normal distribution.</p>
<div id="the-normal-distribution" class="section level4">
<h4>The Normal Distribution</h4>
<p>The figure on the right shows the characteristic properties of the
normal distribution for a population with a mean (<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>) of 0 and a standard deviation (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>) of 1. The plot shows the
frequency of an outcome on the <em>y</em>-axis as a function of the
possible outcomes on the <em>x</em>-axis. The normal distribution is
symmetric around its mean and the most frequent outcome is the mean.</p>
<p>Of particular importance to us is that the percentage of a normally
distributed population that falls within any range of values is defined
only by the population’s mean, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>,
and its standard deviation, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>.
For example, 95.44% of the population is within two standard deviations
on either side of the mean <span class="math inline">\((\mu \pm 2
\sigma)\)</span> and 13.59% of the population falls within the range
<span class="math inline">\(\mu + 1 \sigma\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu + 2 \sigma\)</span>. The total area under the
normal distribution curve—a cumulative probability of 100%—is the same
for all populations.</p>

<div id="the-central-limit-theorem" class="section level4">
<h4>The Central Limit Theorem</h4>
<p>The well-characterized properties of a normal distribution allow us
to draw conclusions about a population based on the analysis of a
limited number of samples drawn at random from the population
<strong>if</strong> we know the samples are normally distributed. The
Central Limit Theorem is simply a statement that regardless of the
distribution of individual samples from a population, the distribution
of the means of samples are normally distributed.</p>
