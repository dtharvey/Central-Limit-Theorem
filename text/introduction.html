<p><span class="math inline">\(\require{mhchem} \ce{}\)</span>The goal
of a quantitative analysis is to determine how much analyte is present
in a small sample drawn from a much larger population. For example, we
might analyze five tablets of the pain reliever acetaminophen drawn at
random from a single bottle that holds 100 tablets, obtaining results of
224.3, 240.4, 261.7, 229.4, and 246.3 mg of acetaminophen. The bottle,
in turn, is drawn from all the bottles in a single production lot, which
might be <span class="math inline">\(10^4\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(10^5\)</span> bottles. To use a sample’s
properties—such as its mean (246.6 mg) or its standard deviation (8.75
mg)—to learn something about the population—such as the percentage of
tablets that are likely to have more than 250 mg of
acetaminophen—requires that we know the mathematical properties of the
population’s distribution. Although there are many different types of
distributions, the distribution that receives the most attention is the
normal distribution, which is defined by its mean, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and its standard deviation, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>.</p>

<h4>The Normal Distribution</h4>
<p>The figure on the right is the normal distribution—a plot of the
frequency of an outcome on the <em>y</em>-axis as a function of the
possible outcomes on the <em>x</em>-axis—for a population that has a
mean, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, of 0 and a standard
deviation, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, of 1. The normal
distribution is symmetric around its mean and the most frequent outcome
is the mean, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. The percentage of
the normally distributed population that falls within any range of
values is defined only by the population’s mean and its standard
deviation. For example, half of a population’s members have values less
than <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, as shown by the area
under the normal distribution shaded in black, and 34.13% have values
between <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu + 1 \sigma\)</span> as shown by the area under
the normal distribution shaded in light blue. The total area under the
normal distribution curve—a cumulative probability of 100%—is the same
for all populations.</p>

<h4>The Central Limit Theorem</h4>
<p>The well-characterized properties of a normal distribution allow us
to draw conclusions about a population based on the analysis of a
limited number of samples drawn at random from the population
<strong><em>if</em></strong> we know the samples are normally
distributed. The Central Limit Theorem is simply a statement that
regardless of the actual distribution of the individual samples that
make up a population, the distribution of the means of samples of
sufficient size, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, drawn from that
population are normally distributed.</p>
