<p><span class="math inline">\(\require{mhchem}\)</span>In a
quantitative analysis we determine how much analyte is present in a
small sample drawn from a much larger population. For example, we might
analyze five tablets of a pain reliever from a single bottle that holds
100 tablets, obtaining results of <span class="math inline">\(224.3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(240.4\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(261.7\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(229.4\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(246.3\)</span> mg. The bottle, in turn, is drawn
from a single production lot, which might be <span class="math inline">\(10^4\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(10^5\)</span> bottles. To use a sample’s
properties—such as its mean or standard deviation—to learn something
about the population, such as the percentage of tablets that are likely
to have more than <span class="math inline">\(250\)</span> mg of pain
reliever, requires that we know the mathematical properties of the
population’s distribution. Although there are many types of
distributions, the distribution that receives the most attention is the
normal distribution, which is defined by its mean, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and its standard deviation, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>.</p>

<h4>The Normal Distribution</h4>
<p>The figure on the right shows a normal distribution for a population
that has a mean, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, of <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and a standard deviation, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, of 1. The frequency of outcomes
is on the <em>y</em>-axis and possible outcomes are on the
<em>x</em>-axis. The percentage of a normal distribution within a range
of values is defined only by the population’s mean and standard
deviation. For example, half of a population’s members have values less
than <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, as shown by the area in
black, and 34.13% have values between <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu +
1 \sigma\)</span> as shown by the area in light blue. The total area
under the normal distribution curve—a cumulative probability of 100%—is
the same for all populations.</p>

<h4>The Central Limit Theorem</h4>
<p>The well-characterized properties of a normal distribution allow us
to draw conclusions about a population based on the analysis of a
limited number of samples drawn at random from the population
<strong><em>if</em></strong> we know the samples are normally
distributed. The Central Limit Theorem is simply a statement that
regardless of the actual distribution of the individual samples that
make up a population, the distribution of the means of samples of
sufficient size, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, drawn from that
population are normally distributed.</p>
