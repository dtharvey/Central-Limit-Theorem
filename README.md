# Central-Limit-Theorm

Introduces students to the central limit theorem. The user can select one of four traditional distributions---normal, uniform, binomial, and Poisson---and a bimodal distribution and observe how an increase in the size of individual samples yields a distribution that closely approximates a normal distribution.
