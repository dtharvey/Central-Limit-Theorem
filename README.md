# Central-Limit-Theorm

A one-page application in a more traditional textual format that introduces the central limit theorem. The user can select one of four traditional distributions—normal, uniform, binomial, and Poisson—a bimodal distribution, and a staircase distribution and observe how an increase in the size of individual samples yields a distribution that appears normal by either stepping through sample sizes or as an animation.
